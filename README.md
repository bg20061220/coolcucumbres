# CoolCucumbers 🥒

**CoolCucumbers** is an application designed to assist both homebuyers and insurance companies:

- **For homebuyers:** Estimates future insurance prices for houses in a given area.  
- **For insurance companies:** Improves risk quantification, helping reduce unexpected financial losses.  

---

## Tech Stack 💻

- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Data:** Environmental data scraped from multiple sources  

---

## Setup & Usage ⚡

Currently, we have a basic working prototype that predicts future environmental conditions (used later for estimating insurance prices).  

**Prototype Link:** [https://coolcucumbresfinal.vercel.app/]  

> ⚠️ Note: The first prediction may take 45–60 seconds due to free hosting limitations. Subsequent predictions are faster (~2–3 seconds).  

**To run locally:**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>

2. Install backend dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install

4. Start the backend :
   ```bash
   flask run

5. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start

## Future Plans 🚀

-  Complete training the model for accurate future enviromental conditions.
-  Build a predicitive model for future insurance prices.
